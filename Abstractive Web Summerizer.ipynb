To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; visitand sat about ten minutes with him in his libraryHe had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladiesof whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the fatherThe ladies were somewhat more fortunatefor they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coatand rode a black horseAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had MrsBennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her an answer arrived which deferred it allMrBingley was obliged to be in town the following to accept the honour of their was quite could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to anotherand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to beLady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that MrBingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assemblyThe girls grieved over such a number of ladiesbut were comforted the day before the ball by hearingthat instead of twelve he brought only six with him from Londonhis five sisters and a cousinAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five two sistersthe husband of the eldestand another young manMrBingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant mannersHis sisters were fine womenwith an air of decided fashionHis looked the gentleman; but his friend MrDarcy soon drew the attention of the room by his finetall featuresnoble mienand the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entranceof his having ten thousand a yearThe gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a manthe ladies declared he was much handsomer than MrBingleyand he was looked at with great admiration for about half the eveningtill his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his companyand above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most being unworthy to be compared with his had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and every dancewas angry that the ball closed so earlyand talked of giving one himself at amiable qualities must speak for a contrast between him and his friend! MrDarcy danced only once with MrsHurst and once with Miss being introduced to any other ladyand spent the rest of the evening in walking about the roomspeaking occasionally to one of his own partyHis character was decidedHe was the proudestmost disagreeable man in the worldand everybody hoped that he would never come there againAmongst the most violent against him was dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her Bennet had been obligedby the scarcity of gentlemento sit down for two dances; and during part of that timeMrDarcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and MrBingleywho came from the dance for a few minutesto press his friend to join itstanding about by yourself in this stupid mannerYou had much You know how I detest itunless I am particularly acquainted with my partnerAt such an assembly as this it would be sisters are engagedand there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a pu girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of at the eldest Miss Bennetis one of her sisters sitting down just behind youwho is very prettyand I dare say very agreeableDo let me ask my partner Elizabethtill catching her eyehe withdrew his own and coldly am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other menYou had better return to your partner and enjoy her smilesfor you are wasting your time with MrBingley followed his adviceMrDarcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward himShe told the great spirit among her friends; for she had a livelyplayful delighted in anything ridiculousThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield had danced with her twiceand she had been distinguished by his sistersJane was as much gratified by this as her mother could bethough in a quieter wayeasureMary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partnerswhich was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ballThey good spirits to Longbournthe village where they livedand of which they were the principal found MrBennet still upWith a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid had disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hearmost delightful eveninga most excellent ballI wish you had been thereJane was so could be like itEverybody said how well she looked; and MrBingley thought her quite beautifuland danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second timeFirst of allhe asked Miss LucasI was so vexed to see him stand up with her! Buthoweverhe did not admire her at all; indeednobody canyou know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the danceSo he inquired who she wasand got introducedand asked her for the two nextThen the two third he danced with Miss Kingand the two fourth with Maria Lucasand the two fifth with Jane againand the two sixth with Lizzyand the _Boulanger_ sakesay no more of his partnersOh that he had sprained his a handsome! And his sisters are charming womenI never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dressesI dare say the lace upo Here she was interrupted againMrBennet protested against any description of fineryShe was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subjectand relatedwith much bitterness of spirit and some shocking rudeness of MrDarcyby not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most mannot at all worth pleasingSo high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! I wish you had been theremy dearto have given him one of your setdownsI quite Chapter When Jane and Elizabeth were alonethe formerwho had been cautious in her praise of MrBingley to her sister just how very much she admired ; and I never saw such happy manners!so ought likewise to beif he possibly canHis character is eat difference between usCompliments always take _you_ by surpriseand _me_ neverWhat could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the roomNo thanks to his gallantry for thatWellhe certainly is very agreeableand I give you leave ike people in generalYou never see a fault in anybodyAll the world are good and agreeable in your eyesI never heard you speak ill of a lways _your_ good senseto be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhereBut to be candid without ostentation or design still betterand say nothing of the badbelongs to you aloneTheir manners at firstBut they are very pleasing women when you converse with themMiss Bingley is to live with her brotherand keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a Elizabeth listened in silencebut was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sisterand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herselfshe was very little disposed to approve themThey were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleasednor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose itbut proud and conceitedThey were rather handsomehad been educated in one of the first private seminaries in townhad a fortune of twenty thousand poundswere in the habit of spending more than they oughtand of associating with people of rankand were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselvesand meanly of othersThey were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories by inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his fatherwho had intended to purchase an estatebut did not live to do itMrBingley intended it likewiseand sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manorit was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temperwhether he might not spend the remainder of his days at leave the next generation to purchaseHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; butthough he was now only established as a tenantMiss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was MrsHurstwho had married a man of more fashion than fortuneless disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited herMrBingley had not been of age two yearswhen he was tempted by an accidental to look at Netherfield HouseHe did look at itand into it for halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal with what the owner said in its praiseand took it him and Darcy there was a very steady friendshipin spite of great opposition of was endeared to Darcy by the ductility of his temperthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his ownand though with his own he never appeared the s regardBingley had the firmest relianceand of his judgement the highest opinionIn was the was by no means deficientbut Darcy was cleverHe was at the same time fastidiousand his mannersthough wellbredwere not invitingIn that respect his friend had greatly the was sure of being liked wherever he appearedDarcy was continually giving offenseThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formalityno stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; andas to Miss Bennethe could not conceive an angel more the contraryhad seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashionfor none of whom he had felt the smallest interestand from none received either attention or pleasureMiss Bennet he acknowledged to be prettybut she smiled too muchMrsHurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked herand pronounced her to be a sweet girland one whom they would not object to know more ofMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girland their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he choseChapter Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimateSir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Merytonwhere he had made a tolerable fortuneand risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoraltyThe distinction had perhaps been felt too stronglyIt had given him a disgust to his businessand to his residence in a small market town; andin quitting them bothhe had removed with his family to a house about a mile from from that period Lucas Lodgewhere he could think with pleasure of his own by himself solely in being civil to all the elated by his rankit did not render him supercilious; on the contraryhe was all attention to everybodyBy nature obliginghis presentation Lady Lucas was a very good kind of womannot too clever to be a valuable neighbour to MrsBennetThey had several childrenThe eldest of thema young womanabout twenty That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to self To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed I rather believe he _did_I heard something about itbut I hardly know whatsometh liked our Meryton assembliesand whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the roomand _which_ he thought the prettiest? he is such a disagreeable manthat it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by himMrsLong told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once because she asked him at last how he liked he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite unless among his intimate _them_ he is agreeablehe would have talked to MrsLongBut I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with prideand I dare say he had heard somehow that MrsLong does not keep a carriagepride often doesbecause there is an excuse for itOne cannot wonder that so very fine a young manwith in his favourshould think highly of himselfIf I ity of that I have ever readI am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to itand that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of on the score of some quality or otherreal or and pride are different thingsthough the words are often used synonymouslyA person may be proud without being vainPride relates more to our opinion of ourselveskeep The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she wouldand the argument ended only with the visitChapter The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of visit was soon returned in due formmanners grew on the goodwill of MrsHurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be the younger sisters not worth speaking toa wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldestBy Janethis attention was received with the greatest pleasurebut Elizabeth still saw in their treatment of excepting even her sisterand could not like them; though their kindness to Janesuch as it washad a value as arising in It was generally evident whenever they metthat he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the firstand was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in generalsince Jane unitedwith great strength of feelinga composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucasimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guardedIf a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of itshe may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the darkThere is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every it is not safe to leave any to itselfWe can all _begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feelsBingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may _I_ can perceive her regard for himhe must be a and Jane meet tolerably oftenit is never for many hours together; andas they always see each other in large mixed partiesit is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing togetherJane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attentionWhen she is secure of himthere will be more leisure for falling in love as in question but the desire of being well marriedand if I were determined to get a rich husbandor any husbandI dare say I acting by designAs yetshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its has known him only a fortnightShe danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own houseand has since dined with him in company four timesThis is not quite enough to make ed_ with himshe might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together them to ascertain that they both like Vingtun better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading do not imagine that much has y heart; and if she were married to him tomorrowI should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a in marriage is entirely a matter of chanceIf the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehandit does not advance their felicity in the leastThey always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the is not soundand that you would never act in Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friendMrDarcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next methe looked at her only to criticiseBut no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her facethan he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyesTo this discovery succeeded some others equally he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her formhe was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable worldhe was caught by their easy playfulnessOf this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhereand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance withHe began to wish to know more of herand as a step towards conversing with her to her conversation with othersHis doing so drew her noticeIt was at Sir William see what he is aboutHe has a very satirical eyeand if I do not begin by being impertinent myselfI shall soon grow afraid On his approaching them soon without seeming to have any intention of speakingMiss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do itshe turned to him and said well just nowwhen I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a going to o always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!

andafter a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negativedshe seated sang with her sisterand while they were thus could not help observingas she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrumenthow frequently Mrthat she could be an object of admiration to so great a man;

but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by herHe really believedthat were it not for the inferiority of her connectionshe should be in some dangerMiss Bingley sawor suspected enough to be jealous;

MrHurst also made her a slight bowand said he halfhour was spent in piling up the firelest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplacethat she might be further from the doorHe then sat down by herand talked scarcely to anyone work in the opposite cornersaw it all with great delightWhen tea was overMrHurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vainShe had obtained private intelligence that MrDarcy did not wish for cards;

My mindhoweveris now made up on the subjectfor having received ordination at EasterI have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourghwidow of Sir Lewis de Bourghwhose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parishwhere it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyshipand be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of EnglandAs a feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your sideand not lead you to reject the offered olivebranchI cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughtersand beg leave to apologise for itas well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafterIf you should have no objection to receive me into your houseI propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your thby four Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remaindear sirwith respectful compliments to your lady and daughtersyour wellwisher and friendmaking seems to be a most conscientious and polite young manupon my wordand I doubt not will prove a valuable if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him and if he is disposed to make them any amendsI shall not be the mean to make us the atonement he thinks our duethe wish is Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherineand his kind intention of burying his parishioners whenever it were requiredout. And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he would help it if he could. Could he be a sensible manf finding him quite the reverseThere is a mixture of servility and in his letterwhich promises wellI am defectiveThe idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly To Catherine and Lydianeither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interestingIt was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coatand it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any away much of her illwilland she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and was punctual to his timeand was received with great politeness by the whole indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talkand MrCollins seemed neither in need of inclined to be silent himselfHe was a young man of air was grave and statelyand his manners were very formalHe had not been long seated before he complimented MrsBennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beautybut that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and addedthat he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriageThis gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but MrsBennetwho quarreled with no most readilymay prove sofor else they will be destitute enoughThings are It is a grievous affair to my poor girlsyou must confessNot that I mean to find fault with _you_for such things I know are all chance in this worldThere is no and could say much on the subjectbut that I am cautious of appearing forward and I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire themAt present I will not say more; we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled admirationThe hallthe diningroomand all its furniturewere examined and praised; and his commendation of everything supposition of his viewing it all as his own future propertyThe dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owingBut he was set right there by MrsBennetwho assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cookand that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchenHe begged pardon for having displeased herIn a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hourChapter During scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawnhe thought it time to have some conversation with his guestand therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shineby observing that he seemed very to his wishesand consideration for his very could not have chosen was eloquent in her praiseThe subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of mannerand with a most important aspect he in a person of ranksuch affability and he had himself experienced from Lady CatherineShe had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before herShe had also asked him twice to dine at Rosingsand had sent for him only the Saturday beforeto make up her pool of quadrille in the eveningLady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knewbut _he_ had never seen anything but affability in herShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or twoto visit his relationsShe had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he couldprovided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been makingand had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself very agreeable womanIt is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like herDoes she live near than many girlsAnd what sort of young lady is she? Is she says thatin point of true beautyMiss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sexbecause there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birthShe is unfortunately of a sickly has prevented her from making that progress in many which she could not have otherwise failed ofas I am informed by the lady who superintended her educationand who still resides with themBut she is perfectly amiableand often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phae town; and by that meansas I told Lady Catherine one dayhas deprived the British court of its brightest ornamentHer ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladiesI have more than once observed to Lady Catherinethat her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchessand that the most elevated rankinstead of giving her be adorned by herThese are the kind of little things which please her ladyshipand it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacyMay I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasionsI always wish to give them as unstudied an air as n was as absurd as he had hopedand he listened to him with the keenest at the same time the most resolute composure of in an occasional glance at no partner in his pleasureBy dose had been enoughand MrBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom againandwhen tea was overglad to invite him to read aloud to the readily assentedand a book was produced;

but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak headliving in retirementand the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperityA fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant;

for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charmingHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beautya fine countenancea good figureand very pleasing addressThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming;

Do not When the dancing Darcy approached to claim her handCharlotte could not help cautioning her in a whispernot to be a simpletonand allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his made no answerand took her place in the setamazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to MrDarcyand reading in her stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dancesand at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talkshe made some slight observation on the danceHe repliedand was again silentAfter a pause of some minutesshe addressed him a second time with something nowMrDarcy_I_ talked about the danceand _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the roomor the He smiledand assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be saidThat reply will do for the by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public must speak a littleyou knowIt would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of ought to be so arrangedas that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possi similarity in the turn of our mindsWe are each of an to speakunless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole roomand be handed down to emblance of your own characterI am He made no answerand they were again silent till they had gone down the dancewhen he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to MerytonShe answered in the effect was immediateA deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his featuresbut he said not a wordand blaming herself for her own weaknesscould not go onAt length blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ he may be equally capable of _retaining_ themis Darcy made no answerand seemed desirous of changing the subjectAt that momentSir William Lucas appeared close to themmeaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving MrDarcyhe stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his dancing is not often seenIt is evident that you belong to the first circlesAllow me to your fair partner does not disgrace youand that I must hope to have this pleasure often when a certain desirable eventmy dear Eliza glancing at her sister and Bingley shall take placeWhat will then flow in! I appeal to MrDarcybut let me not interrupt yousirYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but forciblyand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Janewho were dancing turned to his partnerhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselvesWe have tried two or three subjects already without oh! noI am sure we never read the sameor not with the least be no want of subjectWe may compare our different I cannot talk of books in a ballroom; my head is always full hewith a look of doubther thoughts had wandered far from the subjectas soon hearing you once you hardly ever forgavethat your resentment once created was are very vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wishMiss Bennetthat you were not to sketch my character at the present momentas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no your likeness nowI may never have another repliedShe said no moreand they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side not to powerful feeling towards herwhich soon procured her pardonand directed all his anger against anotherThey had not long separatedwhen Miss Bingley came towards herand with an expression of civil disdain accosted her Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about himand asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell youamong his other he was recommend youhoweveras a friendnot to give implicit illit is perfectly false; foron the contraryhe has always been remarkably kind to himthough George Wickham has treated MrDarcy in a most infamous mannerI do not know the I know very well that MrDarcy is not in the least to blamethat he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentionedand that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officershe was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the wayHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent I wonder how he could presume to do itI pity his descentone could not expect much or I have heard you accuse him use my interference mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as thisI see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of BingleyJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacencya glow of such happy expressionas sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the instantly read her feelingsand at that moment solicitude for against his enemiesand everything elsegave way before the hope you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any satisfactory to tell youMrBingley does not know the whole of his historyand is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended MrDarcy; but he will vouch for the good conductthe probityand honour of his friendand is perfectly convinced that MrWickham has deserved much less attention from MrDarcy than he has received; and I am sorry to means a respectable young manI am afraid he has been very satisfiedBut what does he say of the living? heard them from MrDarcy more than oncebut he believes that it Elizabeth dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the storyand has learnt the rest from that friend himselfI shall She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to eachand on which there could be no difference of listened with delight to the happythough modest hopes which power to heighten her confidence in itOn their being joined by MrBingley withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely repliedbefore MrCollins came up to themand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discoveryis now in the room a near relation of my patronessI happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourghand of her mother Lady CatherineHow wonderfully these sort of things occur! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to himwhich I am now going to doand trust he will excuse my not having done it beforeMy total ignorance of the connection must plead my be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a him that MrDarcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedomrather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it wereit must belong to MrDarcythe superior in consequenceto begin the listened to her with the determined air of following his own she ceased thus in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to saythat there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laityand those which regulate the clergy; forgive me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintainedYou must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasionwhich leads me to perform what I look on as a point of dutyPardon me for neglecting to profit by your advicewhich on every other subject shall be my constant guidethough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a attack MrDarcywhose reception of his advances she eagerly watchedand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evidentHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of itshe felt as if hearing it alland saw in the motion of his lips the word him expose himself to such a manMrDarcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonderand when at last MrCollins allowed him time to speakreplied with an air of distant not discouraged from speaking againand of his second speechand at the end of it he only made him a slight bowand moved another wayMrCollins then returned to Elizabethwith my seemed much pleased with the attentionHe answered me with the utmost civilityand even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady favour unworthilyIt was really a very handsome thoughtUpon As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursueshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and MrBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth tomade her perhaps almost as happy as JaneShe saw her in idea settled in that very housein all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capableunder such endeavouring even to were bent the same wayand she determined not to venture near herlest she might hear too muchWhen they sat down to considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to MrBingleyIt was an animating subjectand MrsBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the matchHis being such a charming young manand so richand living but three miles from themwere the first points of ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Janeand to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could doIt a promising thing for her in the way of other rich men; and lastlyit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sisterthat she might not be obliged to go into company more than she likedIt was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than MrsBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her lifeShe concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of itIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her less audible whisper; forto her inexpressible vexationshe could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by MrDarcywho sat opposite to themHer mother only scolded her for being nonsensicalam sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged for you to offend MrDarcy? You will never recommend yourself to Nothing that she could sayhoweverhad any influenceHer mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible toneElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexationShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at MrDarcythough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mothershe was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by herThe expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravityAt had no more to say; and Lady Lucaswho had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharingwas left to the comforts of cold ham and now began to reviveBut not long was the interval of tranquillity; forwhen supper was oversinging was talked ofand she had the mortification of seeing Maryafter very little to oblige the companyBy many significant looks and silent entreatiesdid she endeavour to prevent such a proof of in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting were fixed on her with most painful sensationsand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Maryon the thanks of the tablethe hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them againafter the pause of fitted for such a display; her voice was weakand her manner was in agoniesShe looked at Janeto see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to BingleyShe looked at his two sistersand saw them making signs of derision at each otherand at Darcywho graveShe looked at her father to entreat his Mary should be singing all nightHe took the hintand when Mary had finished her second songsaid pretending not to hearwas somewhat disconcerted; and El was afraid her anxiety had done no goodOthers of the party were now applied tosingI should have great pleasureI am surein obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversionand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergymanI do not meanhoweverto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to musicfor there are certainly other things to be attended toThe rector of a parish has much to doIn the first placehe must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patronHe must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish dutiesand the care and improvement of his dwellingwhich he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possibleAnd I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards towards those to whom he owes his prefermentI cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roomMany staredmany smiled; but no one looked more amused than MrBennet himselfwhile his wife seriously commended MrCollins for having spoken so sensiblyand observed in a halfwhisper to Lady Lucasthat he was a remarkably clevergood kind of young manTo Elizabeth it appeared thathad her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the eveningit would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his noticeand that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessedThat his two sisters and have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relationswas bad enoughand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentlemanor the insolent smiles of the ladieswere more rest of the evening brought her little amusementShe was teased by MrCollinswho continued most perseveringly by her sideand though he could not prevail on her to dance with him againput it out of her power to dance with othersIn vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody elseand offer to introduce him to any young lady in the roomHe assured herthat as to dancinghe was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole eveningThere was no arguing upon such a projectShe owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucaswho often joined themand good conversation to herselfnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of herquite disengagedhe never came near enough to speakShe felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to MrWickhamand rejoiced in itThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to departandby a manoeuvre of MrsBennethad to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gonewhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the and her sister scarcely opened their mouthsexcept to complain of fatigueand were evidently impatient to have the house to repulsed every attempt of MrsBennet at by so doing threw a languor over the whole partywhich was very little relieved by the long speeches of MrCollinswho was complimenting MrBingley and his sisters on the elegance of their the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guestsDarcy said nothing at allMrBennetin equal silencewas enjoying the and Jane were standing togethera little detached from the restand talked only to each preserved as steady a silence as either MrsHurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation nWhen at length they arose to take was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbournand addressed herself especially to MrBingleyto assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any timewithout the ceremony of a formal was all grateful pleasureand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on herafter his return from Londonwhither he was obliged to go the next day for a short timeMrsBennet was perfectly satisfiedand quitted the house under the delightful persuasion thatallowing for the necessary preparations of carriagesand wedding clothesshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four monthsOf having another daughter married to MrCollinsshe thought with equal certaintyand with not was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_the worth of each was eclipsed by MrBingley and The next day opened a new scene at made his declaration in formHaving resolved to do it without loss of timeas his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturdayand having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the momenthe set about it in a very orderly mannerwith all the he supposed a regular part of the businessOn finding one of the younger girls togethersoon after breakfasthe addressed the mother in these words Elizabethwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of am sure Lizzy will be very happyI am sure she can have no work togethershe was hastening awaywhen Elizabeth called out excuse meHe can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not looksabout to escapesh Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possibleshe sat down again and tried to concealby incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and and Kitty walked offand as soon as they were goneMrCollins beganfrom doing you any adds to your other would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to this addressYou can hardly doubt the purport of my your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be as soon as I entered the houseI singled you out as the companion of my future lifeBut before I am run away with by my feelings on this it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for coming into Hertfordshire with The idea of MrCollinswith all his solemn run away with by his feelingsmade Elizabeth so near laughingthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him furtherand he continued thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondlythat I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdlywhich perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlierthat it is the particular advice and of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too! on this subject;

and your wit and vivacityI thinkmust be acceptable to herespecially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably exciteThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own I can assure you there are many amiable young womenBut the fact isthat beingas I amto inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father whohowevermay live many years longerI could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughtersthat the loss to them might be as little as possiblewhen the melancholy event takes I have already saidmay not be for several yearsThis has been my motivemy fair cousinand I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteemAnd now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affectionTo fortune I am perfectly shall make no demand of that nature on your fathersince I am well aware that it could not be complied with;

that to be in the same roomthe same party with him for so many hours togethermight be more than I could bearShe highly approved his they had leisure for a full discussion of itand for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each otheras Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbournand during the walk he particularly attended to herHis accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herselfand it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and motherSoon after their returna letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from envelope contained a sheet of change as she read itand saw her dwelling intently on some particular passagesJane recollected herself soonand putting the letter awaytried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leavethan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairsWhen they had gained their own out the lettersaid ed me a good dealThe whole party have left Netherfield by this timeand are on their way to townand without any intention of coming She then read the first sentence aloudwhich comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directlyand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Streetwhere MrHurst had a houseThe next was in these words gret anything I shall leave in your societymy dearest friend; but we will hopeat some future periodto enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have knownand in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised hershe saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would societyshe was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard itin the enjoyment of hisnot be able to see your friends before they leave the countryBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is awareand that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? MrBingley will not be detai which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be soand at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it againwe have determined on following him thitherthat he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotelMany of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that youmy dearest friendhad any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that I despairI sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally bringsand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the t st be his own doingHe is his own masterBut you do not know _all_I _will_ read you the passage truth_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her againI really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sisterI do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding themand I trust you will not esteem them brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a these circumstances to favour an attachmentand nothing to prevent itam I wrongmy dearest Janein indulging the hope of expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for himshe means most kindly!

and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brotherfrom the notion that when there has been _one_ may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuityand I dare say it would succeedif Miss de Bourgh were out of the wayButmy dearest Janeyou cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcyhe is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesdayor that it will be in her power to persuade him thatinstead of being in love with youhe is very muc of all this might make me quite easyBut I know the foundation is is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that since you will not take comfort in mineBelieve her to be deceivedby all meansYou have now done your duty by herand accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to mature find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their con The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contemptIt appeared to her merely the suggestion of suppose that those wisheshowever openly or artfully spokencould influence a young man so totally independent of everyoneShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subjectand had soon the pleasure of seeing its gradually led to hopethough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hopethat Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heartThey agreed that MrsBennet should only hear of the departure of the familywithout being conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concernand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate togetherAfter lamenting ithoweverat some lengthshe had the consolation that MrBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbournand the conclusion of all was the comfortable though he had been invited only to a family dinnershe would take care to have two full The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to took an opportunity of thanking in being usefuland that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her timeThis was very amiablebut conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her were so when they parted at nightshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soonBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his characterfor it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slynessand hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feetHe was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousinsfrom a conviction that if they saw him departthey could not fail to conjecture his designand he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secureand with reasonfor Charlotte had been tolerably encouraginghe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of WednesdayHis of the most flattering kindMiss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the houseand instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the laneBut little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the presentthe lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happinessThe stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucaswho accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an not how soon that establishment were gainedSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful daughterto whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fairLady Lucas began directly to calculatewith more interest than the matter had ever excited beforehow many years longer MrBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinionthat whenever MrCollins should be in possession of the Longbourn estateit would be highly expedient that both he and familyin shortwere properly overjoyed on the occasionThe younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved ld maidCharlotte herself was tolerably composedShe had gained her pointand had time to consider of itHer reflections were in general be surewas neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksomeand his attachment to her must be imaginaryBut still he would be her thinking highly either of men or had always been her object; it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortuneand however uncertain of giving happinessmust be their pleasantest preservative from wantThis preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of having ever been handsomeshe felt all the good luck of itThe least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennetwhose friendship she valued beyond that of any other would wonderand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shakenher feelings must be hurt by such a resolved to give her the information herselfand therefore charged MrCollinswhen he returned to Longbourn to dinnerto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the familyA promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully givenbut it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evadeand he was at the same time exercising great selfdenialfor he was longing to publish his prosperous loveAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the familythe ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and MrsBennetwith great politeness and how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn againwhenever his engagements might allow him to visit it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon They were all astonished; and MrBennetwho could by no means wish for so speedy a said tion heremy good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the you for this friendly cautionand you may depend upon my not than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us againwhich I should think exceedingly probablestay quietly at homeand be satisfied that _we_ shall affectionate attention; and depend upon ityou will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for thisand for every other mark of your regard during my stay in for my fair cousinsthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessaryI shall now take the liberty of wishing them health With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girlsand Mary might have been prevailed on to accept himShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck herand though by no means so clever as herselfshe thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hershe might become a very agreeable companionBut on the following morningevery hope of this kind was done awayMiss Lucas called soon after breakfastand in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day beforelove with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herselfand her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorumand she could not help crying out The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her storygave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; thoughas it was no more than she expectedshe soon regained her composureand calmly replied t good he was not so happy as to succeed with But Elizabeth had now recollected herselfand making a strong effort for itwas able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to herand that she wished her all imaginable much surprisedso lately as MrCollins was wishing to marry youBut when you have had time to think it overI hope you will be satisfied with what I have doneI am not romanticyou know; I never wasI ask only a comfortable situation in lifeI am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the Elizabeth quie pausethey returned to the rest of the did not stay much longerand Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heardIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a matchThe strangeness was nothing in comparison of his being now acceptedShe had ion of matrimony was not exactly like her ownbut she had not supposed it to be possible thatwhen called into actionshe would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly the wife of MrCollins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteemwas added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosenChapter Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and on what she had heardand doubting whether she was authorised to mention itwhen Sir William Lucas himself appearedsent by his daughterto announce her engagement to the familyWith many compliments to themand much on the prospect of a connection between the houseshe unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wonderingbut incredulous; for MrsBennetwith more perseverance than he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydiaalways unguarded and often exclaimed you Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his informationhe listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situationnow put herself forward to confirm his accountby mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her to Sir Williamin which she was readily joined by Janeand by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the matchthe excellent character of MrCollinsand the convenient distance of Hunsford from was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid ventIn the first placeshe persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondlyshe was very sure that MrCollins had been taken in; thirdlyshe trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthlythat the match might be broken offTwo plainly deduced from the whole onethat Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the dayNothing could console and nothing could appease herNor did that day wear out her resentmentA week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding hera month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rudeand many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughterand such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified himhe saidto discover that Charlotte Lucaswhom he had been used to think tolerably sensiblewas as foolish as his wifeand more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucasfor MrCollins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at MerytonLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on MrsBennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness awayBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them againHer in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sisterof whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shakenand for whose happiness she grew daily more anxiousas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his returnJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letterand was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear againThe promised letter of thanks from MrCollins arrived on to their fatherand written with all the might have promptedAfter discharging his conscience on that headhe proceeded to inform themwith many rapturous expressionsof his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbourMiss Lucasand then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherinehe addedso heartily approved his marriagethat she wished it to take place as soon as possiblewhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of menpleasure to MrsBennetOn the contraryshe was as much disposed to complain of it as her husbandIt was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly hated having visitors in the house while her health was so lovers were of all people the most were the gentle murmurs of MrsBennetand they gave way only to the Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subjectDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed MrsBennetand which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehoodEven Elizabeth began to fearnot that Bingley was that his sisters would be successful in keeping him awayUnwilling as she was to happinessand so dishonorable to the stability of her lovershe could not prevent its frequently occurringThe united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too muchshe fearedfor the strength of his attachmentAs for Jane_her_ anxiety under this suspense wasof coursemore painful than Elizab desirous of concealingand between herself and subject was never alluded toBut as no such delicacy restrained her motheran hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of her impatience for his arrivalor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable returned most punctually on Monday fortnightbut his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first was too need much attention; and luckily for the othersthe business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his companyThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodgeand he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bedMrsBennet was really in a most pitiable stateThe very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumourand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked ofThe sight of Miss Lucas was odious to herAs her successor in that houseshe regarded her with jealous Charlotte came to see themshe concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to MrCollinswas convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estateand resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the houseas soon as MrBennet were deadShe complained bitterly of all this to her Lucas should ever be mistress of this housethat _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_and live to see her take for better thingsLet us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the This was not very consoling to MrsBennetand of making any answershe went on as anyone could have the conscience to entail away an the sake of MrCollins too!

You will hardly bear to be long outdone by JaneNow is your timeHere are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the countryLet Wickham be your manHe is a whatever of that kind may befall youyou have an affectionate gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn familyThey saw him oftenand to his other was now added that of general unreserveThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heardhis claims on MrDarcyand all that he had suffered from himwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked MrDarcy before they had known anything of the matterMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the caseunknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowancesand urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else MrDarcy was condemned as the worst of menChapter After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of SaturdayThe pain of be alleviated on his sideby preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hopethat shortly after his return into day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of menHe took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness againand promised their father another letter of thanksOn the following had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wifewho came as usual to spend the Christmas at was a mangreatly superior to his sisteras well by nature as educationThe Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by tradeand within view of his own have been so wellbred and was several years younger than MrsBennet and an womanand a great favourite with all her Longbourn niecesBetween the two eldest and herself subsisted a particular regardThey had frequently been staying with her in her presents and describe the newest fashionsWhen this was done she had a less active part to playIt became her turn to had many grievances to relateand much to complain ofThey had all been very illused since she last saw her sisterTwo of her girls had been upon the point of marriageand after all there was nothing in itMrBingley if she couldBut Lizzy! It is very hard s timehad it not been for her own made her an offer in this very roomand she refused himThe consequence of it isthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I haveand that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as everThe Lucases are very artful people are all for what they can getI am sorry to say it of thembut so it isIt makes me very nervous and poorlyto be thwarted so in my own familyand to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody coming just at this time is the greatest of comfortsand I am very glad to hear what you MrsGardinerto whom the chief of this news had been given hermade her sister a slight answerandin compassion to her niecesturned the alone with Elizabeth afterwardsshe spoke more on the so often! A young mansuch as you describe MrBingleyso easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeksand when accident separates themso easily forgets herthat these sort will not do for _us_We do not suffer by accidentIt does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a fe doubtfulso it gives me very little ideaIt is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half to a realstrong _violent inattentive to other peopleand wholly engrossed by herEvery time they metit was more decided and remarkableAt his own ball he offended two or three young ladiesby not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myselfwithout receiving an answerCould there be finer symptoms?

a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a pointwithout being returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucaseshis arrival was no great inconvenience to MrsBennetHis marriage was now fast she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitableand even repeatedly to sayin an illished_ Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose reluctant good wishesand sincerely affected her out of the roomAs they went downstairs said Elizabeth could not refusethough she foresaw little pleasure in the visitThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church doorand everybody had as much to sayor to hearon the subject as soon heard from her friend; and their was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was overand though determined not to slacken as a was for the sake of what received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new homehow she would like Lady Catherineand how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; thoughwhen the letters were readElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseenShe wrote surrounded with comfortsand mentioned nothing which she could not praiseThe roadswere all to her obligingIt was Mr rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the restJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote hoped it would be in her power to say something of the BingleysHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally isJane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from CarolineShe accounted for ithoweverby supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lostmorrow into that part of the townand I shall take the opportunity of calling in She wrote again when the visit was paidand she had seen Miss t she was very glad to see meand reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to LondonI was last letter had never reached herI inquired after their brotherof courseHe was wellbut so much engaged with MrDarcy that they scarcely ever saw himI found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinnerI wish I could see herMy visit was not longas Caroline and MrsHurst were going outI dare say I Elizabeth shook her head over this letterIt convinced her that townFour weeks passed awayand Jane saw nothing of himShe endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but waiting at home every morning for a fortnightand inventing every evening a fresh excuse for herthe visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stayand yet morethe alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longerThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she feltLizzy willI am surebe incapable of triumphing in her better judgementat my expensewhen I confess myself to my dear sisterthough the event has proved you rightdo not think me obstinate if I still assert what her behaviour wasmy confidence was as natural as your suspicionI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen againI am sure I should be deceived againCaroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a notenot a linedid I receive in the meantimeWhen she did comeit was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slightformal apologyfor not calling beforesaid not a word of wishing to see me againand was in every respect so altered a creaturethat when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longerI pitythough I cannot help blaming herShe was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her sideBut I pity herbecause she must feel that she has been acting wrongand because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of itI need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needlessyet if she feels itit will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiableI cannot but her having any such fears nowbecauseif he had at all cared about mewe must have metlong agoHe knows of my being in townI am certainfrom something she said herself; and yet it would seemby her manner of talkingas if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss DarcyI cannot understand itIf I were not afraid of judging harshlyI should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all thisBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thoughtand think only of what will make me happyyour affectionand the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and auntLet me hear from you very soonMiss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield againof giving up the housebut not with any certaintyWe had better not mention itI am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at HunsfordPray go to see themwith Sir William and MariaI am sure you will be very comfortable thereThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be dupedby the sister at leastAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely overShe would not even wish for a renewal of his attentionsHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for himas well as a possible advantage to Janeshe seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr accountshe would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentlemanand required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herselfHis apparent partiality had subsidedhis attentions were overhe was the admirer of some one elseElizabeth was watchful enough to see it allbut she could see it and write of it without material painHer heart had been but slightly touchedand her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choicehad fortune permitted itThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabethless clearsighted perhaps in m for his wish of the contrarycould be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish hershe was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for bothand could very sincerely wish him happyAll this was acknowledged to MrsGardiner; and after relating auntthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passionI should at present detest his very nameand wish him all manner of evilBut my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss KingI cannot find out that I hate her at allor that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girlThere can be no love in all thisMy watchfulness has been effectual;

but in general Charlotte wisely did not hearAfter sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the roomfrom the sideboard to the fenderto give an account of their journeyand of all that had happened in invited them to take a stroll in the gardenwhich was large and well laid outand to the cultivation of which he attended himselfTo work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures;

and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased withthough she could not be in such raptures as MrCollins expected the scene to inspireand was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the houseand his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourghmoment increasingand even Sir William did not look perfectly of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtueand the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without the which MrCollins pointed outwith a rapturous airthe fine proportion and the finished ornamentsthey followed the servants through an antechamberto the room where Lady Catherineher daughterand MrsJenkinson were sittingHer ladyshipwith great to receive them;

told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hersand instructed her as to the care of her cows and her found that nothing was beneath this great dictating to othersIn the intervals of her discourse with MrsCollinsshe addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabethbut especially to the latterof whose connections she knew the leastand who she observed to MrsCollins was a very genteelpretty kind of girlShe asked herat different timeshow many sisters she hadwhether they were older or younger than any of them were likely to be they were handsomewhere they had been educatedwhat carriage aiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very Catherine then observedI see no occasion for entailing estates from the female lineIt some time or other we shall be happy to hear youOur instrument is a capital oneprobably superior toYou shall try to have learnedThe Miss Webbs all playand their father has not so good an income mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thingYour Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the caseas wished to learn never wanted the meansWe were always encouraged to readand had all the masters that were necessaryand if I had known your motherI should have advised her most strenuously to engage oneI always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular nobody but a governess can give itIt is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that wayI am always glad to get a young person well placed outFour nieces of MrsJenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young personwho was merely accidentally mentioned to meand the family are quite delighted with I tell you iss secondThe younger ones out before the elder ones are married! hard upon younger sistersthat they should not have their share of society and the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry earlyThe lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the firstAnd to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to decidedly for so young a pers Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified When the gentlemen had joined themand tea was overthe cardtables were placedLady CatherineSir Williamand Mrand MrsCollins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassinothe two girls had the honour of assisting MrsJenkinson to make up her partyTheir table was superlatively a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the gameexcept when MrsJenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de B too much or too little lightA great deal more passed at the other tableLady Catherine was generally the mistakes of the three othersor relating some anecdote of was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship saidthanking her for every fish he wonand apologising if he thought he won too manySir William did not say muchHe was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble namesWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chosethe tables were broken upthe carriage was offered to accepted and immediately orderedThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrowFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the they had driven from the doorElizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at than it really wasBut her costing her some troublecould by no means satisfy MrCollinsand he was very Chapter Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsfordbut his visit was comfortably settledand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met withWhile Sir William was with themMrCollins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gigand showing him the country; but when he went awaythe whole family returned to their usual Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alterationfor the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writingand looking out of the window in his own bookroomwhich fronted the roadThe room in which the ladies sat was had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use; it was a better sized roomand had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she didfor MrCollins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartmenthad they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the laneand were indebted to MrCollins for the knowledge of what carriages went alongand how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaetonwhich he never failed coming to inform them ofthough it happened almost every dayShe not conversation with Charlottebut was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get outVery few days passed in which MrCollins did not walk to Rosingsand not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed ofshe could not understand the sacrifice of so many hoursNow and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyshipand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visitsShe examined into their at their workand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any to do it meat were too large for her soon perceivedthat though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the countyshe was a most active magistrate in her own parishthe minutest concerns of which were carried to her by MrCollins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be too poorshe sallied forth into the village to settle their their complaintsand scold them into harmony and plentyThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; andallowing for the loss of Sir Williamand there being only one cardtable in the eveningevery such entertainment was the counterpart of the firstTheir other engagements were fewas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond howeverwas no evil to Elizabethand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with Charlotteand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doorsHer favourite walkand where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherinewas along the open grove which edged that side of the parkwhere there was a nice sheltered pathwhich no one seemed to value but curiosityIn this quiet waythe first fortnight of her visit soon passed awayEaster was the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosingswhich in so small a circle must be had heard soon after her arrival that MrDarcy was expected there in the course of a few weeksand though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not preferhis coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings partiesand she might be amused behaviour to his cousinfor whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherinewho talked of his coming with the greatest of him in terms of the highest admirationand seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herselfHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for MrCollins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lanein order to have the earliest assurance of itand after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Parkhurried home with the great the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respectsThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require themfor MrDarcy had brought with him a Colonel younger son of his uncle Lord andto the great surprise of all the partywhen MrCollins returnedthe gentlemen accompanied himCharlotte had see immediately running into the othertold the girls what an honour they might expectadding would never hav Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the their approach was announced by the doorbelland shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the roomColonel led the waywas about thirtynot handsomebut in person and address most truly the looked just as he had been used to look in his his usual reserveto MrsCollinsand whatever might be his feelings toward her friendmet her with every appearance of merely curtseyed to him without saying a wordColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred manand talked very pleasantly; but his cousinafter having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to MrsCollinssat for some time without speaking to anybodyAt civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her familyShe answered him in the usual wayand ave you She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Janeand she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss BennetThe subject was pursued no fartherand the gentlemen soon afterwards went awayChapter nners were very much admired at the Parsonageand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at RosingsIt was some they received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the housethey could not be necessary; and it was not till a week after attentionand then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the eveningFor the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the timebut MrDarcy they had seen only at churchThe invitation was accepted of courseand at a proper hour they roomHer ladyship received them civillybut it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she wasin factalmost engrossed by her to to Darcymuch more than to any other person in the roomColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was friend had moreover caught his fancy very muchHe now seated himself by herand talked so agreeably of Kent and travelling and staying at homeof new books and musicthat Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before;

I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so wellThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of othersMy courage always rises at could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herselfand said a very pretty notion of meand teach you not to believe a word I sayI am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real characterin a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in me leave to sayvery impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliateand such thi but prepare yourself for something very dreadfulThe first time of my ever seeing him in must knowwas at a balland at this ballwhat do you think he did?

It must have been a most agreeable surprise to MrBingley to see you all after him so soon; forif I recollect righthe went but the day beforeHe and his sisters were wellI hopeShe found that she was to receive no other a short pause added probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the futureHe has many friendsand is at a time of life when friends and engagements would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirelyfor then we might possibly get a settled family did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his ownand we must Elizabeth made no answerShe was afraid of talking longer of his friend; andhaving nothing else to saywas now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to houseLady CatherineI believedid a great deal to and I am sure she could not have bestowed her very fortunate in his choice of a one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted himor have made him happy if they hadMy friend has an excellent I am not certain that I consider her marrying MrCollins as the wisest thing she ever didShe seems perfectly in a prudential light it is n half a said MrsCollins was settled _near_ he beyond the very neighbourhood of LongbournI supposewould As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and she blushed as she answered her familyThe far and the near must be relativeand depend on many varying there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling becomes no evilBut that is not the case _here_Mrand MrsCollins have a comfortable incomebut not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand I am persuaded my friend would not call herself cannot have a right to such very strong local Elizabeth looked surprisedThe gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chairtook a newspaper from the tableand glancing over itsaidin a colder voice A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensuedon either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sisterjust returned from her walkThe _têteàtête_ surprised themMrDarcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennetand after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybodywent awayBut when Elizabeth told of his silenceit did not seem very various could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to dowhich was the more probable from the time of yearAll field sports were overWithin doors there was Lady a gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonageor the pleasantness of the walk to itor of the people who lived in itthe two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every dayThey called at various times of the togetherand now and then accompanied by their auntIt was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their societya persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with himas well as by his evident admiration of herof her former favourite George Wickham; and thoughin comparing themshe saw there was less believed he might have the best informed mindBut why MrDarcy came so often to the Parsonageit was more difficult to understandIt could not be for societyas he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speakit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to proprietynot a pleasure to himselfHe seldom appeared really knew not what to make of himColonel Fitzwillia laughing at his that he was generally her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of loveand the object of that love her friend Elizashe set herself seriously to work to find it outShe watched him whenever they were at Rosingsand whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much successHe certainly looked at her friend a great dealbut the expression of that look was disputableIt was an gazebut she often doubted whether there were much admiration in itand sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mindShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to herbut Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and MrsCollins did not think it right to press the subjectfrom the danger of raising expectations which might only end in ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a suppose him to be in her powerIn her kind schemes for Elizabethshe sometimes planned her marrying Colonel FitzwilliamHe was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired herand his situation in life was most eligible; butto these had considerable patronage in the churchand his cousin could have none at allChapter More than once did Elizabethin her ramble within the meet MrDarcyShe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was broughtandto prevent its ever happening againtook care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hersHow it could occur a second very odd! Yet it didand even a thirdIt seemed like wilful illnatureor a voluntary penancefor on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then awaybut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with herHe never said a great dealnor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected her pleasure in being at Hunsfordher love of happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the househe seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ tooHis words seemed to imply itCould he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposedif he meant anythinghe must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarterIt distressed her a littleand she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in of being again surprised by MrDarcyshe saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting herPutting away the letter immediately and forcing a smileshe said generally do every yearand intend to close it with a call at And accordingly she did turnand they walked towards the Parsonage togetherif Darcy does not put it off againBut I am at his least pleasure in the great power of choiceI do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes means of having it than many othersbecause he is richand many others are poorI speak feelinglyA younger sonyou knowmust be inured to self of eitherNow seriouslywhat have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence?

Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manageand if she has the As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truthShe directly replied I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the worldShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my and Miss BingleyI think I have heard you sa man MrBingleyand takes a prodigi in those points where he most wants careFrom something that he told me in our journey hitherI have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to himBut I ought to beg his pardonfor I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meantIt ally BingleyWhat he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the of a most imprudent marriagebut without mentioning names or any other I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sortand from knowing them to have been together the whole of erstood that there were some very strong objections against Elizabeth made no answerand walked onher heart swelling with watching her a asked her why she was so thoughtfulr s inclinationor whyupon his own judgement alonehe was to determine and direct in what manner his friend we know none of the particularsit is not fair to condemn himIt is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of MrDarcythat she would not trust herself with an answerand changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the into her own roomas soon as their visitor left themshe could think without interruption of all that she had heardIt was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom MrDarcy could have such boundless influenceThat he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of themIf his own not mislead him_he_ was the causehis pride and caprice were the causeof all that Jane had sufferedand still continued to sufferHe had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have having one uncle who was a country attorneyand another who was in business in of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!her understanding excellenther mind improvedand her manners could anything be urged against my with some abilities MrDarcy himself need not disdainand which he will confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with MrDarcywhose prideshe was receive a deeper wound from the want of sense; and she was quite decidedat lastthat he had been partly governed by this worst kind of prideand partly by the wish of retaining MrBingley for his sisterThe agitation and tears which the subject on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the to her unwillingness to see MrDarcyit determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosingswhere they were engaged to drink that she was really unwelldid not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but MrCollins could not conceal his staying at homeChapter When they were if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against MrDarcychose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in KentThey contained no actual complaintnor was there any revival of past occurrencesor any communication of present sufferingBut in alland in almost every line of eachthere was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her styleand from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyonehad been scarcely ever noticed every sentence conveying the idea of an attention which it had hardly received on the sufferingsIt was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the nextanda still greaterthat in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane againand enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spiritsby all that affection could doShe co that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at alland agreeable as he wasshe did not mean to be unhappy about himWhile settling this pointshe was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbelland her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himselfwho had once before called late in the eveningand might now come to inquire particularly after herBut this idea was soon banishedand her spirits were very differently her utter amazementshe saw MrDarcy walk into the roomIn an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her his visit to a wish of hearing that she were betterShe answered him with cold civilityHe sat down for a few momentsand then getting upwalked about the roomElizabeth was surprisedbut said not a wordAfter a silence of several minuteshe came towards her in an agitated mannerand thus began be repressedYou must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire was silentThis he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he feltand had long felt for followedHe spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of prideHis sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was woundingbut was very unlikely to recommend his suitIn spite of her deeplyrooted dislikeshe could not be though her intentions did not vary for an instantshe was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; tillroused to resentment by his subsequent languageshe lost all compassion in angerShe compose herself to answer him with patiencewhen he should have doneHe concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment whichin spite of all his endeavourshe had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his handAs he said thisshe could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answerHe _spoke_ of apprehension and anxietybut his countenance expressed real securitySuch a circumstance could only exasperate he ceasedthe colour rose into her cheeksand she said express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowedhowever unequally they may be returnedIt is natural that obligation should be feltand if I could _feel_ gratitudeI would now thank youBut I cannotI have never desired your good opinionand you have certainly bestowed it most unwillinglyI am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyoneIt has been most unconsciously I hope will be of short durationThe feelings whichyou tell mehave long prevented the of your regardcan have little difficulty in overcoming it after MrDarcywho was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her faceseemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surpriseHis complexion became pale with angerand the disturbance of his mind was visible in every featureHe was struggling for the appearance of composureand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained itThe voice of forced calmnesshe said is is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!

But I have other know I haveHad not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferentor had they even been favourabledo you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of for everthe happiness of a most As she pronounced these wordsMrDarcy changed colour; but the emotion was shortand he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_You dare notyou cannot denythat you have been the principalif not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and the other to its derision for disappointed hopesand involving them both in misery of the acutest kindShe pausedand saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorseHe even looked at her with a smile of affected that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sisteror that I rejoice in my _him_ Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflectionbut its meaning did not escapenor was it likely to conciliate herdislike is foundedLong before it had taken place my opinion of you was decidedYour character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from MrWickhamOn this subjectwhat can you have to say? or under what can you Darcyin a less tranquil toneand with a heightened have been great indee reduced him to his present state of povertyYou have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for himYou have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desertYou have done all this!

So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent h appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affectionBut his pridehis abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Janehis unpardonable assurance in he could not justify itand the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned MrWickhamhis cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to denysoon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excitedShe continued in very made her feel how unequal hurried her away to her roomChapter Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyesShe could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; andtotally indisposed for employmentshe resolvedsoon after breakfastto indulge herself in air and exerciseShe was proceeding directly to her coming there stopped herand instead of entering the parkshe turned up the lanewhich led farther from the park paling was still the boundary on one sideand she soon passed one of the gates into the groundAfter walking two or three times along that part of the laneshe was temptedby the pleasantness of the morningto stop at the gates and look into the parkThe five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the countryand every day was adding to the verdure of the early treesShe was on the point of continuing her walkwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; andfearful of its being MrDarcyshe was directly retreatingBut the person who advanced was now near enough to see herand stepping forward with her nameShe had turned away; but on hearing herself calledthough in a voice which proved it to be MrDarcyshe moved again towards the gateHe had by that time reached it out a letterwhich she instinctively tookthe grove some time in the hope of meeting youWill you do me bowturned again into the plantationand was soon out of sightWith no expectation of pleasurebut with the strongest opened the letterandto her still increasing an envelope containing two sheets of quite throughin a very close handThe envelope itself was likewise fullPursuing her way along the laneshe then began itIt was dated from Rosingsat eight and was as follows apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to youI write without any intention of paining youor humbling myselfby dwelling on wishes whichfor the happiness of bothcannot be too soon forgotten;

I believed it on impartial convictionas truly as I wished it in reasonMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put asidein my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to meBut there were other causes of repugnance; causes whichthough still existingand existing to an equal degree in both instancesI had myself endeavoured to forgetbecause they were not immediately before meThese causes familythough nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequentlyso almost uniformly betrayed by herselfby your three younger sistersand occasionally even by your fatherPardon meIt pains me to offend youBut amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relationsand your displeasure at this of themlet it give you consolation to consider thatto have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censureis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sisterthan it is honourable to the sense and disposition of bothI will only say farther that from what passed that eveningmy opinion of all parties was confirmedand every inducement heightened which could have led me beforeto preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connectionHe left Netherfield for Londonon the day followingas youI am the design of soon had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brotherwe shortly resolved on joining him directly in LondonWe accordingly wentand there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choiceI describedand enforced them this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriagehad it not been seconded by the assuranc had before believed her to return his affection with sincereif not with equal regardBut Bingley has great natural modestywith a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his ownTo convince he had deceived himselfwas no very difficult pointTo persuade him against returning into that conviction had been givenwas scarcely the work of a momentI cannot blame myself for having done thus muchThere is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conce as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of itThat they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some dangerPerhaps this disguise was beneath me; it is it was done for the bestOn this subject I have nothing more to sayno other apology to offerIf I have wounded your which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficientI have not yet learnt to condemn themthat othermore weighty accusationof having injured MrWickhamI can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my familyOf what he has accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relateI can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracitymany years the management of all the Pemberley estatesand whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickhamwho was his godsonhis kindness was therefore liberally bestowedMy father supported him at schooland afterwards at Cambridgemost important assistanceas his own fatheralways poor from the extravagance of his wifewould have been unable to give him a always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of himand hoping the church would be his to provide for him in itAs for myselfit is manymany years since I first began to think of him in a very different mannerThe vicious want of he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friendcould not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himselfand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded momentswhich MrDarcy could not haveHere again I shall give you painto what degree you only can tellBut whatever may be the sentiments which MrWickham has createda suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterit adds even another to MrWickham was to the last so steadythat in his will he particularly recommended it to meto promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowand if he took ordersdesired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacantThere was also a legacy of one thousand poundsHis own father did not long survive mineand within half a year from these wrote to inform me thathaving finally resolved against taking ordershe hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantagein lieu of the prefermentby which he could not be benefitedHe had some intentionhe addedof studying lawand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support thereinI rather wishedthan believed him to be sincere; butat any ratewas perfectly ready to accede to his proposalI knew that MrWickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the churchwere it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive itand accepted in return three thousand poundsAll connection between us seemed now dissolvedI thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberleyor admit his society in townIn town I believe he chiefly livedbut his studying the law was a mere pretenceand being now free from all restrainthis life was a life of idleness and about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for himhe applied to me again by letter for the assured meand I had no difficulty in believing itwere exceedingly badHe had found the law a most unprofitable studyand was now absolutely resolved on being ordainedif I would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubtas he was well assured that I had no other person to provide forand I could hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreatyor for resisting every repetition to itHis resentment was in proportion to the distress of his he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myselfAfter this period every appearance of acquaintance was droppedHow he lived I know notBut last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human beingHaving said thus muchI feel no doubt of your secrecyMy sisterwho is more than ten years my juniorwas left to the guardianship of m nephewColonel myselfAbout a year agoshe was taken from schooland an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over itto Ramsgate; and thither also went by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and MrsYoungein whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aidhe so far recommended himself to affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a childthat she was persuaded to believe herself in loveand to consent to an elopementShe was then but fifteenwhich must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudenceI am happy to addthat I owed the knowledge of it to herselfI joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopementand then to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a the whole to meYou may imagine what I felt and how I actedRegard for my wrote to MrWickhamwho left the place Mrsthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducementHis revenge would have been complete indeedhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as falseyou willI hopeacquit me henceforth of cruelty towards MrWickhamI know not in what mannerunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered atIgnorant as you previously were of everything concerning could not be in your powerand suspicion certainly not in your ; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealedFor the truth of everything here relatedI can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel our near relationship and constant willhas been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valuelessyou cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting himI shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morningI will only addGod bless youChapter If Elizabethwhen MrDarcy gave her the letterdid not expect it to contain a renewal of his offersshe had formed no expectation at all of its contentsBut such as they wereit may well be supposed how eagerly she went through themand what a contrariety of emotion they excitedHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be definedWith amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuadedthat he could have no explanation to givewhich a just sense of shame would not concealWith a strong prejudice against everything he might sayshe began his account of what had happened at read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bringwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyesto be false; and his account of the realthe worst objections to the matchmade her too angry to have any wish of doing him justiceHe expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitentbut haughtyIt was all pride and insolenceBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of MrWickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events whichif truemust overthrow every cherished opinion of his worthand which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of even herShe wished to discredit it entirelymust be the groand when she had gone through the whole letterthough scarcely knowing anything of the last page or twoput it hastily that she would not regard itthat she would never look in it againIn this perturbed state of mindwith thoughts that could rest on nothingshe walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded againand collecting herself as well as she couldshe again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickhamand commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentenceThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late MrDarcythough she had not before known its extentagreed equally well with his own wordsSo far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the willthe difference was greatWhat Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memoryand as she recalled his very wordsit was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; andfor a few momentsshe flattered herself that her wishes did not errBut when she read and reread with the closest attentionthe particulars immediately following of receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand poundsagain was she forced to hesitateShe put down the letterweighed every circumstance with what she meant to be on the probability of each statementbut with little successOn both sides it was only she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affairwhich she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could infamouswas capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the wholeThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to soas she could bring no proof of its injusticeShe had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militiain which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man whoon meeting him accidentally in townhad there renewed a slight his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himselfAs to his real characterhad information been in her powershe had never felt a wish of inquiringHis manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtueShe tried to recollect some instance of goodnesssome distinguished trait of integrity or might rescue him from the attacks of MrDarcy; or at leastby the predominance of virtueatone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what no such recollection befriended herShe could see him instantly before herin every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the the regard which his social powers had gained him in the messAfter pausing on this point a considerable whileshe once more continued to readButalas! the story which followedof his designs on Miss Darcyreceived some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the whose character she had no reason to questionAt one time she had almost resolved on applying to himbut the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the at length wholly banished by the conviction that MrDarcy would never have hazarded such a proposalif he had not been well assured of his She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herselfin their first evening her memoryShe was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such to a strangerand wondered it had escaped her beforeShe saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had doneand the inconsistency of his professions with his conductShe remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing MrDarcythat MrDarcy might leave the countrybut that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next weekShe remembered also thattill the Netherfield family had quitted the countryhe had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reservesno scruples respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the sonHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishesbut his eagerness to grasp at anythingHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortuneor had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shownEvery lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of MrDarcyshe could not but allow that MrBingleywhen questioned by Janehad long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his mannersshe had neverin the whole course of their acquaintance which had latterly brought them much togetherand given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brotherand that she had often heard him speak so of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what MrWickham represented themso gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of itand such an amiable man as MrBingleywas grew absolutely ashamed of herselfOf neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been on my discernment! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sisterand gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!

My aunt Phillips wants you so to taken MrCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in itLord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the ballsDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; by the byeMrsForster and me are _such_ friends! and so she asked the two Harringtons to comebut Harriet was illand so Pen was forced to come by herself; and thenwhat do you think we did? Not a soul knew of itbut Colonel and MrsForsterand Kitty and meexcept my auntfor we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! and so did MrsForsterI thought I should have diedAnd _that_ made the men suspect somethingand With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokesdid amuse her companions all the way to listened as little as she couldbut there was no escaping the frequent Their reception at home was most kindMrsBennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did MrBennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth Their party in the diningroom was largefor almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them Lady Lucas was inquiring of Mariaafter the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; MrsBennet was doubly engagedon one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Janewho sat some way below herandon the them all to the younger Lucases; and enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear hersuch fun! As we went alongKitty and I drew up the blindsand pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the wayif Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the GeorgeI do think we behaved very handsomelyfor we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the worldand if you would have gonewe would have treated you tooAnd then when we came away it was such fun!

They could have been understood only by her motherwho might conso intending to go there himselfBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continuedwith little the very day of leaving homeElizabeth was now to see MrWickham for the last timeHaving been frequently in company with him since her was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely soShe had even learnt to detectin the very gentleness which had first delighted heran affectation and a sameness to disgust and wearyIn his present behaviour to had a fresh source of the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serveafter what had since passedto provoke herShe lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed itcould not but feel the reproof contained in his believingthat however longand for whatever causehis attentions had been withdrawnher vanity would be gratifiedand her preference secured at any time by their other of the officersat Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humourthat on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had if he was acquainted with the and a returning he had formerly seen him often; andafter observing that he was a very gentlemanlike manasked her how she had liked himHer answer was warmly in his favourWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added ok which did not escape heradd aught of civility to his ordinary style?for I dare not While she spokeWickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her wordsor to distrust their meaningThere was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious she added ntanceI did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of thatfrom knowing him betterhis disposition was better agitated look;

and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourghwhich I am certain Elizabeth could not repress a smile at thisbut she answered only by a slight inclination of the headShe saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievancesand she was in no humour to indulge himThe rest of the evening passed with the his sideof usual with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civilityand possibly a mutual desire of never meeting againWhen the party broke upLydia returned with MrsForster to Merytonfrom whence they were to set out early the next morningThe separation between her and her family was rather noisy than patheticKitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envyMrsBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughterand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewellthe more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heardChapter could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfortHer by youth and beautyand that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally givehad married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrownBut MrBennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the which his own imprudence had brought onin any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their viceHe was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoymentsTo his wife he was very little otherwise indebtedthan as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusementThis is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wantingthe true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are never been blind to the impropriety of pain; but respecting his abilitiesand grateful for his affectionate treatment of herselfshe endeavoured to forget what she could not overlookand to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum whichin exposing his wife to the contempt of her own childrenwas so highly she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriagenor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents;

and general is only warded off by the defence of some little When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expectedand always very shortThose to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the librarywhere such and such officers had attended themand where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gownor a new parasolwhich she would have described more fullybut was obliged to leave off in a violent hurryas MrsForster called herand they were going off to the camp; and from her with her sisterthere was still less to be learntfor her letters to Kittythough rather longerwere much too full of lines under the words to be made publicAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her humourand cheerfulness began to reappear at wore a happier aspectThe families who had been in town for the winter came back againand summer finery and summer engagements was restored to her usual querulous serenity; andby the middle of JuneKitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a dayunlessby some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Officeanother regiment should be quartered in MerytonThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast a fortnight only was wanting of itwhen a letter arrived from at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in Julyand must be in London again within a monthand as that left too short a period for them to go so farand see so much as they had proposedor at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built onthey were obliged to give up the Lakesand substitute a more contracted to the present planwere to go no farther northwards than DerbyshireIn that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to MrsGardiner it had a peculiarly strong attractionThe town where she had formerly passed some years of her lifeand where they were now to spend a few dayswas probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of the PeakElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakesand still thought there might have been time enoughBut it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right againWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connectedIt was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of county with impunityand rob it of a few petrified spars without The period of expectation was now doubledFour weeks were to lBut they did pass awayand Mrand their four childrendid at length appear at LongbournThe childrentwo girls of six and eight years oldand two younger boyswere to be left under the particular care of their cousin Janewho was the general favouriteand whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching themplaying with themand loving themThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbournand set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusementOne enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear to enhance every pleasureand affection and might supply it among themselves if there were abroadIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshirenor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; sufficiently knownA small part of Derbyshire is all the present concernTo the little town of she had lately learned some acquaintance still remainedthey bent their stepsafter having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of found from her aunt that Pemberley was situatedIt was not in their direct roadnor more than a mile or two out of itIn talking over their route the evening expressed an inclination to see the place declared his Elizabeth was applied to for her which so many of your acquaintances are passed all his youth Elizabeth was distressedShe felt that she had no business at Pemberleyand was obliged to assume a for seeing itShe must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so manyshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin ; but the grounds are have some of the Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesceThe possibility of meeting MrDarcywhile viewing the occurredIt would be dreadful! She blushed at the very ideaand thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a riskBut against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resourceif her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably she retired at nightshe asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? A most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removedshe was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morningand she was again applied tocould readily answerand with a proper air of she had not really any dislike to the schemeTo were to goChapter Elizabethas they drove alongwatched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodgeher spirits were in a high flutterThe park was very largeand contained great variety of groundThey entered it in one of its lowest pointsand drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extentadmired every remarkable spot and point of viewThey gradually ascended for halfamileand then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminencewhere the wood ceasedand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley Housesituated on the opposite side of a valleyinto which the road with some abruptness woundIt was a largehandsome stone well on rising groundand backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in fronta stream of some natural importance was swelled into greaterbut without any artificial appearanceIts banks were neither formal nor falsely was delightedShe had never seen a place for which nature had done moreor where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward tasteThey were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hillcrossed the bridgeand drove to the door; andwhile examining the nearer aspect of the houseall her apprehension of meeting its owner returnedShe dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistakenOn applying to see the placethey were admitted into the hall; and Elizabethas they waited for the leisure to wonder at her being where she wasThe housekeeper came; a elderly womanmuch less fineand more civilthan she had any notion of finding herThey followed her into the was a largewell proportioned fitted slightly surveying itwent to a window to enjoy its prospectThe hillcrowned with woodwhich they had increased abruptness from the distancewas a beautiful objectEvery disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scenethe riverthe trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valleyas far as she could trace itwith delightAs they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seenThe rooms were lofty and handsomeand their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth sawwith admiration of his tastethat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendourand more real elegancethan the furniture of RosingsWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a strangerI might have rejoiced in them as my ownand welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and recollecting herself uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been This was a lucky saved her from something very like regretShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absentbut had not the courage for itAt length howeverthe question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with expect him tomorrowwith a larg rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a pictureShe approached and saw the likeness of several other the aunt asked she liked itThe housekeeper came forwardand told them it looked at her niece with a smilebut Elizabeth could not return itand very like himIt was drawn at the same time as the other respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her masterery up stairs you will see a finerlarger picture of him than are just as they used to be thenHe was very fond of This accounted to Eli MrsReynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcydrawn when she was only eight years handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!She plays and sings all day longIn the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master; she comes here to manners were very easy and her by his questions and remarks; by pride or attachmenthad evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sisterhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer Mrand MrsGardiner could not help sayingwas going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the This was praiseof all others most opposite to her ideasThat he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinionHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear moreand was grateful to her uncle for saying could not meet with a betterBut I have always observedthat they who are goodnatured when childrenare goodnatured when they grow up; and he was always the generous shehim Elizabeth was impatient for could interest her on no other pointShe related the subjects of the picturesthe dimensions of the roomsand the price of the furniturein amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her mastersoon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircaseever lived; not like the wild young men nowadayswho think of nothing but is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good nameSome people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of itTo my fancyit reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcywho had taken a liking to the room when last at one of the windowshe addedThe two or three of the principal bedroomswere all that remained to be shownIn the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible belowshe had willingly turned to were usually more also more the gallery there were many family portraitsbut they could have little to fix the attention of a walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to herAt last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to MrDarcywith such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at herShe stood several minutes before the picturein earnest returned to it again before they quitted the gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their commendation bestowed on him by MrsReynolds was of no trifling natureWhat praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a happiness were in his guardianship!how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his characterand as she stood before the canvas on which he was fixed his eyes upon herselfshe thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmthand softened its impropriety of all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seenthey returned leave of the consigned over to the gardenerwho met them at the halldoorAs they walked across the hall towards the turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped alsoand while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the buildingthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the roadwhich led behind it to the stablesThey were within twenty yards of each otherand so abrupt was his it was impossible to avoid his sightTheir eyes instantly metand the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blushHe absolutely startedand for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering towards the partyand spoke to Elizabethif not in terms of perfect composureat least of perfect civilityShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcomeHad his first appearanceor his resemblance to the picture they had just been examiningbeen insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw MrDarcythe gardener expression of surpriseon beholding his mastermust immediately have told itThey stood a little aloof while he was talking to their and dared lift her eyes to his faceand knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her familyAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last partedevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mindthe few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her lifeNor did he seem much more at ease; when he spokehis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbournand of her having stayed in Derbyshireso oftenand in so hurried a wayas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughtsAt length every idea seemed to fail him; andafter standing a few moments without saying a wordhe suddenly recollected himselfand took leaveThe others then joined herand expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a wordand wholly engrossed by her own them in silenceShe was overpowered by shame and vexationHer coming there was the most most illjudged thing in the world! Had they been only ten minutes soonerthey should have been beyond the reach of his ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriageShe blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meetingAnd his behaviourso strikingly alteredwhat could it mean? Never in her life had she seen his manners so little had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meetingWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Parkwhen he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to thinkor how to account for itThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the waterand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of groundor a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; andthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and auntand seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed outshe distinguished no part of the sceneHer thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley it might bewhere MrDarcy then wasShe longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he thought of herand whetherin defiance of everythingshe was still dear to himPerhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like easeWhether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tellbut he certainly had not seen her with composureAt remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused herand she felt the necessity of appearing more like herselfThey entered the woodsand bidding adieu to the river for a whileascended some of the higher grounds; whenin spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wanderwere many charming views of the valleythe opposite hillswith the long range of woods overspreading manyand occasionally part of the expressed a wish of going round the whole parkbut feared it might be beyond a walkWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles roundIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them againafter some timein a descent among hanging woodsto the edge of the waterand one of its narrowest partsThey crossed it by a simple bridgein character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valleyhere contracted into a glenallowed room only for the streamand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered itElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridgeand perceived their distance from the was not a great walkercould go no fartherand thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possibleHer niece to submitand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the riverin the nearest direction; but their progress was slowfor seldom able to indulge the tastewas very fond of fishingand was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the waterand talking to the man about themthat he advanced but littleWhilst wandering on in this slow mannerthey were what it had been at firstby the sight of MrDarcy approaching themand at no great distanceThe walk here being here less sheltered than on the other sideallowed them to see him before they astonishedwas at least more prepared for an interview than beforeand resolved to appear and to speak with calmnessif he really intended to meet themFor a few felt that he would probably strike into some other pathThe idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning pasthe was immediately before themWith a glanceshe saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; andto imitate his politenessshe beganas they metto admire the beauty of the place; but she some unlucky recollections obtrudedand she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construedHer colour changedand she said no was standing a little behind; and on her pausinghe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friendsThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herselfare? The immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herselfshe stole a sly look at himto see how he bore itand was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he sustained ithoweverwith fortitudeand so far from going awayturned back with themand entered into conversation with could not but be pleasedcould not but triumphIt was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blushShe listened most attentively to all that passed between themand gloried in every sentence of her unclewhich marked his tasteor his good mannersThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard MrDarcy invite himwith the greatest civilityto fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the at the same time to supply him with fishing tackleand pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most was walking arminarm with Elizabethgave her a look expressive of said nothingbut it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herselfHer extremeand can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softenedMy reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as thisIt is impossible that he should After walking some time in this waythe two ladies in frontthe two gentlemen behindon resuming their placesafter descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious chanced to be a little alterationIt originated in by the exercise of the her nieceand they walked on togetherAfter a short silencethe lady first spokeShe wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the placeand accordingly began by observingthat his arrival had been very unexpected you would certainly not be here till tomorrow; and indeedbefore we left Bakewellwe understood that you were not of it alland said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with who acquaintance with you Elizabeth answered only by a slight bowHer thoughts were been the last mentioned between them; andif she might judge by his mind was not very differently engagedyou allow meor do I ask too muchto introduce my sister to The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to itShe immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her looking fartherit was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of herThey now walked on in silenceeach of them deep in was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleasedHis wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kindThey soon outstripped the othersand when they had reached the carriageMrand MrsGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behindHe then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tiredand they stood together on the lawnAt such a time much might have been saidand silence was very awkwardShe wanted to talkbut there seemed to be an embargo on every subjectAt last she recollected that she had been travellingand they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _têteàtête_ was overinto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declinedand they parted on each side with utmost handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove offElizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the houseThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they it is confined to his airand is not unbecomingI can now say with the though some more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attentionHis acquaintance with Elizabeth was Wickham; orratherhe h features are perfectly goodBut how came you to tell me that he Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than beforeand that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morningshall not take him at his wordas he might change his mind Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his characterbut said nothingreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor WickhamHe has not an illnatured lookOn the contrarythere is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaksAnd there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heartButto be surethe good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimesBut he is a liberal masterI here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understandin as guarded a manner as she couldthat by what she had heard from his relations in Kenthis actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so been considered in confirmation of thisshe related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been actually naming her authoritybut stating it to be such as might be relied onMrsGardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything elseFatigued as she had been by again in quest of her former the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she allof his wishing her to be acquainted with his sisterChapter Elizabeth had settled it that MrDarcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morningBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambtonthese visitors cameThey had been walking about the place with some of their new friendsand were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same familywhen the sound of a carriage drew them to a windowand they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the immediately recognizing the liveryguessed what it meantand imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expectedHer uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spokejoined to the circumstance itselfand many of the circumstances of the preceding dayopened to them a new idea on the had ever suggested it beforebut they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their nieceWhile these newlyborn notions were passing in their headsthe perturbation quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquietshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; andmore than commonly anxious to pleaseshe naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail herShe retreated from the windowfearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the to compose herselfsaw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worseMiss Darcy and her brother appearedand this formidable introduction took placeWith astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herselfSince her being at Lambtonshe had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shyShe found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a Darcy was talland on a larger scale than Elizabeth; andthough little more than sixteenher figure was formedand her appearance womanly and gracefulShe was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her faceand her manners were perfectly unassuming and had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever MrDarcy had beenwas much relieved by discerning such different feelingsThey had not long been together before MrDarcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her prepare for such a visitorwhen entered the roomAl done away; but had she still felt anyit could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her againHe inquired in a general wayafter her familyand looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever doneTo Mrand MrsGardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herselfThey had long wished to see himThe whole party before a lively attentionThe suspicions which had just arisen of MrDarcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to loveOf the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident her sidehad much to doShe wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her ownand to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter objectwhere she feared most to failshe was most sure of successfor those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favourBingley was was eagerand Darcy determinedto be pleasedIn seeing Bingleyher thoughts naturally flew to her sister; andoh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasionsand once or twice pleased herself with the notion thatas he looked at herhe was trying to trace a this might be imaginaryshe could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcywho had been set up as a rival to JaneNo look appeared on either side that spoke particular regardNothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sisterOn this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they partedwhichin her anxious a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tendernessand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of herhad he daredHe observed to herat a moment when the others were talking togetherand in a tone which had something of real regretthat monthsWe have not met since the th of Novemberwhen we were Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask herwhen unattended to by any of the restwhether _all_ her sisters were at was not much in the questionnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaningIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on MrDarcy himself; butwhenever she did catch a glimpseshe saw an expression of general in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companionsas convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might provehad at least outlived one dayWhen she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civilnot only to herselfbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdainedand recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonagethe differencethe change was so greatand struck so forcibly on her mindthat she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being in the company of his dear friends at Netherfieldor his dignified relations at Rosingshad she seen him so desirous to pleaseso free from or unbending reserveas nowwhen no importance could result from the success of his endeavoursand when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and RosingsTheir visitors stayed with them above halfanhour; and when they arose to departMrDarcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mrand Miss Bennetto dinner at they left the countryMiss Darcythough with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving looked at her niecedesirous of knowing how _she_whom the invitation most concernedfelt disposed as to its acceptancebut Elizabeth had turned away her headPresuming howeverthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposaland seeing in her husbandwho was fond of societya perfect willingness to accept itshe ventured to engage for her attendanceand the day after the next was fixed onBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth againhaving still a great deal to say to herand many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sisterwas pleasedand on this accountas well as some othersfound herselfwhen their visitors left themcapable of considering the last halfhour with some while it was passingthe enjoyment of it had been littleEager to be aloneand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and auntshe stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingleyand then hurried away to dressit was not their wish to force her was evident that she was much better acquainted with MrDarcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with herThey saw much to interestbut nothing to justify inquiryOf MrDarcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; andas far as their acquaintance reachedthere was no fault to findThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn without any reference to any other accountthe circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for MrDarcyThere was now an believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years oldand whose own manners indicated not to be hastily had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weightThey had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably hadand if notit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visitIt was he was a liberal manand did much good among the poorWith respect to Wickhamthe travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understoodit was yet a wellknown fact thaton his quitting Derbyshirehe had left many debts behind himwhich MrDarcy afterwards dischargedAs for Elizabethher thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the eveningthough as it passed it seemed longwas not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them outShe certainly did not hate himNo; hatred had vanished long agoand she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against himthat could be so calledThe respect created by the conviction of his valuable at first unwillingly admittedhad for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier natureby the testimony so highly in his favourand bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a lightwhich yesterday had producedBut above allabove respect and esteemthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlookedIt was gratitude; gratitudenot merely for having once loved herbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting himand all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejectionHe whoshe had been avoid her as his greatest enemyseemedon this accidental meetingmost eager to preserve the without any indelicate display of regardor any peculiarity of mannerwhere their two selves only were concernedwas soliciting the good opinion of her friendsand bent on making her known to his sisterSuch a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to loveardent loveit must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouragedas by no means it could not be exactly definedShe respectedshe esteemedshe was grateful to himshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herselfand how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the powerwhich her fancy told her she still possessedof bringing on her the renewal of his addressesIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberleyfor she had reached it only to a late to be it could not be equalledby some exertion of politeness on their side; it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morningThey goElizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reasonshe had very little to say in left them soon after breakfastThe fishing scheme had been renewed the day beforeand a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noonChapter had originated in jealousyshe could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to herand was acquaintance would now be renewedOn reaching the housethey were shown through the hall into the saloonwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summerIts windows opening to the a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the houseand of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawnIn this house they were received by Miss Darcywho was sitting there with MrsHurst and Miss Bingleyand the lady with whom civilbut attended with all the embarrassment whichthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrongwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and and her her justiceand pitied herBy MrsHurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey;

and between her and occasional help from Elizabeththe conversation was carried onMiss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingleyand that she could not speak a to Miss Darcywithout calling her attentionThis observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latterhad they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying muchHer own thoughts were employing herShe expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the roomShe wishedshe feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it mostshe could scarcely sitting in was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her familyShe answered with equal indifference and brevityand the other said no moreThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meatcakeand a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from MrsAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been givento remind her of her postThere was now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all talkthey could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of peaches soon collected them round the tableWhile thus had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of MrDarcyby the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and thenthough but a moment before she had believed her wishes to began to regret that he cameHe had been some time with two or three other gentlemen from the housewas engaged by the riverand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morningNo sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be madebut perhaps not the more easily keptbecause she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against themand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the roomIn no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperateand her attentions to MrDarcy were by no means overMiss Darcyon her Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquaintedand forwarded as much as possibleevery attempt at conversation on either sideMiss Bingley saw all this likewise; andin the imprudence of angertook the first opportunity of sayingwith sneering civility shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ f Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave xerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attackshe presently answered the question in a tolerably detached toneWhile she spokean involuntary glance showed her Darcywith a heightened looking at herand his sister overcome with confusionand unable to lift up her eyesHad Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friendshe undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partialto make her betray a sensibility which latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corpsNot a syllable had creature had it been revealedwhere secrecy was to particularly anxious to conceal itfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to himof their becoming hereafter her ownHe had certainly formed such a planand without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennetit is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingleyvexed and not approach nearer to also recovered in timethough not enough to be able to speak any moreHer brotherwhose eye she feared to meetscarcely recollected her interest in the affairand the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while MrDarcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on not favour; his judgement could not errAnd he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiableWhen Darcy returned to the saloonMiss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sisterer in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winterShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and However little MrDarcy might have liked such an addresshe contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summercould see any beauty in herHer face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsomeHer nose wants is nothing marked in its linesHer teeth are tolerablebut not out of the common way; and as for her eyeswhich have sometimes been called so fineI could never see anything extraordinary in themThey have a sharpshrewish lookwhich I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeththis was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettledshe had all the success she expectedHe was resolutely a determination of making him speakshe continued we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one nightafter they had been I should as soon call her d to improve on youand I _that_ was only when I first saw herfor it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my He then went awayand Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visitas they what had particularly interested them bothThe look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were of the person who had mostly engaged their attentionThey talked of his sisterhis friendshis househis fruitof everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what MrsGardiner thought of himand MrsGardiner would have been highly gratified by beginning the Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was overand her sister justifiedby the receipt of two letters from her at onceon one of which was marked that it had been missent was not surprised at itas Jane had written the direction remarkably illThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and auntleaving her to enjoy them in quietset off by themselvesThe one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days agoThe beginning contained an account of all their little parties and such news as the country afforded; but the latter halfwhich was dated a day laterand written in evident agitationgave more important was to this effect of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all wellWhat I have to say relates to poor LydiaAn express came at twelve last nightjust as we were all gone to bedfrom Colonel Forsterto inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truthwith Wickham!

I grieve to Colonel Fis not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopesand said he feared Wwas not a man to be trustedMy poor mother is really illand keeps her roomCould she exert herselfit would be better; but this is not to be expectedAnd as to my fatherI never in my life saw him so affectedPoor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidenceone cannot wonderI am truly gladdearest Lizzythat you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but nowas the first shock is overshall I own that I long for your return?

But I knew notI was afraid of Darcy made no answerHe seemed scarcely to hear herand was walking up and down the room in earnest meditationhis brow contractedhis air soon observedand instantly understood itHer power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weaknesssuch an assurance of the deepest disgraceShe could neither wonder nor condemnbut the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosomafforded no palliation of her distressIt wason the calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved himas nowwhen all love must be vainBut selfthough it would intrudecould not engross herLydiathe misery she was bringing on them allsoon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her was soon lost to everything else; andafter a pause of several minuteswas only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her a manner whichthough it spoke likewise absencenor have I anything to plead in excuse of my staybut realthough unavailing concernWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wisheswhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanksThis unfortunate affair willI fearprevent the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to that urgent business calls us home the unhappy truth as long as it is possibleI know it cannot be He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hopeand leaving his compliments for her relationswith only one lookwent awayAs he quitted the roomElizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their full of and at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its would formerly have rejoiced in its terminationIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnaturalin comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its objectand even before two words have been can be said in her defenceexcept that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickhamand that its ill success her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachmentBe that as it mayshe saw him go must producefound additional anguish as she reflected on that aning to marry herNo one but Janeshe thoughtcould flatter herself with such an was the least of her feelings on this the contents of the first letter remained in her mindshe was all surpriseall astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared now it was all too naturalFor such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriageshe had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy preyShe had never the regiment was in Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to one anotherhad been her favouriteas their attentions raised them in her opinionHer affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an objectThe mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh! She was wild to be at hometo hearto seeto be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon herin a family so derangeda father absenta mother incapable of exertionand requiring constant attendance; and though almost interference seemed of the utmost importanceand till he entered the room her impatience was severeMrand MrsGardiner had their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that headshe eagerly communicated the cause of their the two letters aloudand dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energyThough Lydia had never been a favourite with themMrand MrsGardiner could not but be deeply afflictedNot Lydia onlybut all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and promised every assistance in his expecting no lessthanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one relating to their journey was speedily settledThey were to be off as MrsGardin But wishes were vainor at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hourHad Elizabeth been at leisure to be idleshe would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her auntand amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambtonwith false excuses for their sudden departureAn the whole completed; and MrGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the innnothing remained to be done but to go; and all the misery of the morningfound herselfin a shorter space of time than she could have in the carriageand on the road to am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matterIt appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendlessand who was inclined to hope the bestCould he expect that her friends would not step forward? His d up for a interestfor him to be guilty ofI cannot think so very ill of WickhamCan you wholly give him neglect I can believe him should be so! But I dare not hope itWhy should they not go on to Scotland if t their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! Andbesidesno traces of them were to be supposing them to be in LondonThey may be therethough for the purpose of no more exceptional purposeIt is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more less in London than their marriage be private? Ohnonothis is not likelyHis of his never intending to marry herWickham will never marry a woman without some moneyHe cannot afford itAnd what claims has Lydiawhat attraction has she beyond good humour that could make himfor her sakeforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with herI am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produceBut as to your other objectionI am afraid it will hardly hold goodLydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imaginefrom attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his familythat _he_ would do as littleand think as little of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than decency and virtue in such a point should admit of know not what to sayPerhaps I am not doing her justiceBut she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last a has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanityShe has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous mannerand to adopt any opinions that came in her waySince the shire were first quartered in but officers have been in her headShe has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subjectto give greaterwhat shall I call it? to her feelings; which are naturally lively enoughAnd we all know that Wickham has every charm of person ill of Wickham as to believe h might be their former conductthat she would think capable of such an attempttill it were proved against them? But Jane knowsas well as I dowhat Wickham really isWe both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all aliveother dayof his infamous behaviour to MrDarcy; and you yourselfwhen last at in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards himAnd there are other circumstances which I am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endlessFrom what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a girlYet he knew to the contrary himselfHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found thatthat is the worst of allTill I was in Kentand saw so much both of MrDarcy and his relation Colonel FitzwilliamI was ignorant of the truth myselfAnd when I returned homethe shire was to leave Meryton in a week or o whom I related the wholenor Ithought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any onethat the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with MrsForsterthe necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to meThat _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my headThat such a consequence as _this_ could ensueyou may easily believewas I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown awayWhen first he entered the corpsshe was ready enough to admire him; but so we all wereEvery girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention; a moderate period of extravagant and wild admirationher fancy for him gave wayand others of the regimentwho treated her with more became her It may be easily believedthat however little of novelty could be added to their fearshopesand conjectureson this interesting subjectby its repeated discussionno other could detain them from it longduring the whole of the journeyFrom ixed there by the keenest of all could find no interval of ease or travelled as expeditiously as one night on the roadreached Longbourn by dinner time the next dayIt was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long little by the sight of a chaisewere standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; andwhen the carriage drove up to the doorthe joyful surprise that lighted up their facesand displayed itself over their whole bodiesin a variety of capers and friskswas the first pleasing earnest of their jumped out; andafter giving each of them a hasty kisshurried into the Janewho came running Elizabethas she embraced herwhilst tears filled the eyes of bothlost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitivesto say that he had arrived in safetyand to give me his I particularly begged him to doHe merely added that he should not write again till he had something of r is tolerably wellI trust; though her spirits are greatly shakenShe is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you allShe does not yet leave her Her her of her being perfectly well; and their had been passing while Mrand MrsGardiner were engaged with their childrenwas now put an end to by the approach of the whole partyJane ran to her uncle and auntand welcomed and thanked them bothwith alternate smiles and tearsWhen they were all in the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the othersand they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to giveThe sanguine hope of the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end welland that every morning would bring some lettereither from Lydia or her fatherto explain their their whose apartment they all repairedafter a few expected; with tears and lamentations of against the villainous conduct of Wickhamand complaints of her own sufferings and illusage; blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owingt in going to Brightonwith all my family_this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of herWhy did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their sidefor she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked afterI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruledas I always amPoor dear child! The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his graveand if you are not kind to usThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and general assurances of his affection for her and all her familytold her that he meant to be in London the very next dayand would assist MrBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydiato be prepared for the worstthere is no occasion to look on it as certainIt is not quite a week since they left BrightonIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not marriedand have no design of marryingdo not let us give the matter over as lostAs soon as I get to town I shall go to my brotherand make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what t I could most wish forAnd now dowhen you get to townfind them outwherever they may be; and if they are not married already_make_ them marryAnd as for wedding clothesdo not let them wait for thatbut tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy themafter they are allkeep MrBennet from fightingTell him what a dreadful state I am inthat I am frighted out of my witsand have such over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my headand such beatings at heartthat I can get no rest by night nor by dayAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen mefor she does not know which are the best he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the causecould not avoid recommending moderation to heras well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the tablethey all left her to vent all her feelings on the attended in the absence of her her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the familythey did not attempt to oppose itfor they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servantswhile they waited at tableand judged it better that _one_ only of the householdand the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subjectIn the diningroom they were soon joined by Mary and Kittywho had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance beforeOne came from her booksand the other from her toiletteThe faces of tolerably calm; and no change was visible in eitherexcept that the loss of her favourite sisteror the anger which she had herself incurred in this businesshad given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of KittyAs for Maryshe was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabethwith a countenance of grave after they were seated at table talked ofBut we must stem the tide of maliceand pour into the in Elizabeth no inclination of replyingshe om it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazementbut was too much oppressed to make any to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before themIn the afternoonthe two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any Jane was equally eager to satisfyAfter joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this eventwhich Elizabeth considered as all but certainand Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossiblethe former continued the which I have not already heardGive me further did Colonel Forster say?

but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deservedShe had never heard of his having had any a father and motherboth of whom had been dead many yearsIt was some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting itthe application was a something to look forward toEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expectedThe arrival Through of good or bad was to be told would be every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importanceBut before they heard again from MrGardinera letter arrived for their fatherfrom a different quarterfrom MrCollins; whichas Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absenceshe accordingly read; and Elizabethwho knew what curiosities his letters always werelooked over herand read it likewiseIt was as follows ed uponby our my situation in lifeto condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering underof which we were yesterday informed by a letter from assuredmy dear sirthat MrsCollins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable familyin your present distresswhich must be of the bitterest kindbecause proceeding from a cause which no time can removeNo arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort youunder a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a blessing in comparison of thisAnd it is the more to be there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs methat this of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; thoughat the same timefor the consolation of yourself and MrsBennetI am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bador she could not be guilty of such an enormityat so early an ageHowsoever that may beyou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by MrsCollinsbut likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughterto whom I have related the affairThey agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for whoas Lady Catherine herself sayswill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflectwith augmented a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwiseI must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgraceLet me then advise youdear sirto console yourself as much as possibleto throw off your unworthy child from your affection for everand leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to sendIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connectionand it was certain that he had no near one livingHis former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militiait did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of themThere was no could be pointed out as likely to give any news of himAnd in the wretched state of his own financesthere was a very powerful motive for secrecyin had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amountColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at BrightonHe owed a good deal in townbut his debts of honour were still more did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn familyJane heard MrGardiner added in his letterthat they might expect to see their father at home on the following daywhich was spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavourshe had yielded to his brotherin return to his familyand leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuitWhen MrsBennet was told of thisshe did not express so much satisfaction as her children what her anxiety for his life had been beforeAs MrsGardiner began to wish to be at homeit was settled that she and the children should go to Londonat the same time that MrBennet came from itThe them the first stage of their journeyand brought its master back to went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the worldHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of which MrsGardiner had formedof their being followed by a letter from himhad ended in had received none since her return that could come from PemberleyThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; be fairly conjectured from _that_though Elizabethwho was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelingswas perfectly aware thathad she known nothing of Darcyshe would have spared hershe thoughtone sleepless night out of twoWhen MrBennet arrivedhe had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composureHe said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him awayand it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of itIt was not till the afternoonwhen he had joined them at teathat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and thenon her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have enduredHuman nature is so prone to fall into it!

I did not expect it from _you_that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ sideIf you do not choose to understand meforgive my uncle is as much surprised as I amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has doneBut if you are really innocent and ignorantI must be more explicithome from Longbournyour uncle had a most unexpected calledand was shut up with him several hoursIt was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have beenHe came to tell MrGardiner that he had found out where your sister and MrWickham wereand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham onceFrom what I can collecthe left Derbyshire only one day after ourselvesand came to town with the resolution of hunting for themThe motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in himHe generously imputed the whole to his mistaken prideand confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the worldHis character was to speak for itselfHe called duty to step forwardand endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himselfIf he _had another_ motiveI am sure it would never disgrace himHe had been some days in townbefore he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his searchwhich was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow usa MrsYoungewho was some time ago governess to Miss Darcyand was dismissed from her charge on some cause of he did not say whatShe then took a large house in has since maintained herself by letting lodgingsThis MrsYounge washe acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to townBut it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wantedShe would not betray her trustI bribery and corruptionfor she really did know where her friend was to be foundWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in Londonand had she been able to receive them into her housethey would have taken up their abode with herAt kind friend procured the wishedfor directionThey were in streetHe saw Wickhamand afterwards insisted on seeing LydiaHis first object with herhe been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situationand return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive heroffering his assistanceas far as it would goBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she wasShe cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving WickhamShe was sure they should be married some time or otherand it did not much signify whenSince such were her feelingsit only remainedhe thoughtto secure and expedite a his very first conversation with Wickhamhe easily learnt had never been _his_ designHe confessed himself obliged to leave the regimenton account of some debts of honourwhich were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill folly aloneHe meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situationhe could conjecture very little about itHe must go somewherebut he did not know whereand he knew he should have nothing to live onried your sister at onceThough MrBennet was not imagined to be very richhe would have been able to do something for himand his situation must have been benefited by marriageBut he foundin reply to this questionthat Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other countryUnder such was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate reliefseveral timesfor there was much to be of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonablewas to make your uncle acquainted with itand he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came homeBut MrGardiner could not be seenand MrDarcy foundon further inquirythat your father was still with himbut would quit town the next morningHe did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncleand therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the formerHe did not leave his nameand till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on I said beforethey had a great deal of talk togethergain on Sundayand then _I_ saw him tooIt was not all settled before Monday as soon as it wasthe express was sent off to LongbournBut our visitor was very obstinateI obstinacy is the real defect of his allHe has been accused of many faults at different timesbut _this_ is the true oneNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure and I do not speak it to be say nothing about ityour uncle would most readily have settled the wholeeither the gentleman or lady concerned in it deservedBut at last your uncle was forced to yieldand instead of being allowed to be of use to his niecewas forced to put up with only having the probable credit of itwhich went sorely against the grain;

hopeless of seeing him beforeBut on the third morning after his arrival in saw himfrom her dressingroom windowenter the paddock and ride towards the houseHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joyJane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabethto satisfy her motherwent to the windowshe looked,she saw MrDarcy with himand sat down again by her sistern it his and so it doesI vowWellany Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concernShe knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshireand therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sisterin seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letterBoth sisters were uncomfortable enoughEach felt for the otherand of course for themselves; and their mother talked onof her dislike of MrDarcyand her resolution to be civil to him only But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Janeto whom she had never yet had courage to shew towards himTo Janehe could be only a man whose proposals she had refusedand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive informationhe was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefitsand whom she regarded herself with an interestif not quite so tenderat least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for BingleyHer astonishment at his comingat his coming to Netherfieldto Longbournand voluntarily seeking her againwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in DerbyshireThe colour which had been driven from her facereturned for half a minute with an additional glowand a smile of delight added lustre to her eyesas she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshakenBut she would not be secureShe sat intently at workstriving to be composedand without daring to lift up her eyestill anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the doorJane looked a little paler than usualbut more sedate than increased; yet she received them with tolerable easeand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary said as little to either as civility would allowand sat down again to her workwith an eagerness which it did not often commandShe had ventured only one glance at DarcyHe looked seriousas usual; andshe thoughtmore as he had been used to look in as she had seen him at what he was before her uncle and auntIt was a painfulbut not an had likewise seen for an instantand in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassedHe was received by MrsBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamywas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill inquiring of her how Mrand MrsGardiner dida question which she could not answer without confusionsaid scarcely anythingHe was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in he had talked to her friendswhen he could not to herselfBut now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when to resist the impulse of curiosityshe raised her eyes to his faceshe as often found him looking at Jane as at herselfand frequently on no object but the groundMore and less anxiety to pleasethan when they last metwere plainly expressedShe was angry with herself for being soShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;

and he was more less eccentricthan the other had ever seen himBingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the to get every body away from him and her had a letter to writewent into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cardsshe could not be wante But on returning to the her letter was finishedshe sawto her infinite surprisethere was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for herOn opening the doorshe perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearthas if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicionthe faces of bothas they hastily turned round and moved away from each otherwould have told it all_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought was still worseNot a syllable was uttered by either;

and when MrBennet joined them at supperhis voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he wasNot a his lips in allusion to ittill their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gonehe turned to his daughterand said Jane went to him himand thanked him for his you will be so happily settledI have not a doubt of your doing very well togetherYour tempers are by no means unlikeYou are each of you so complyingthat nothing will ever be resolved on;

But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone onif you had been left to yourselfI wonder when you _would_ have spokenif I had not asked you!

and though feeling no reliance on hercould not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deservedThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delightand all her earnest desire of being loved by her sisterBefore any answer could arrive from MrCollinsor any to Elizabeth from his wifethe Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas LodgeThe reason of this sudden removal was soon evidentLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her was anxious to get away till the storm was blown overAt such a momentthe arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly boughtwhen she saw MrDarcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husbandHe bore ithoweverwith admirable calmnessHe could even listen to Sir William Lucaswhen he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the countryand expressed his ho very decent composureIf he did shrug his shouldersit was not till Sir William was out of sighton his forbearance; and though MrsPhillipsas well as her sisterstood in too much awe of him to speak with the she _did_ speakshe must be vulgarNor was her respect for himthough it made her more quietat all likely to make her more did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of eitherand was ever anxious to keep him to herselfand to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasureit added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to eitherto all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which MrsBennet got rid of her two most deserving daughtersWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited MrsBingleyand talked of MrsDarcymay be guessedI wish I could sayfor the sake of her familythat the of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husbandwho might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a formthat she still was occasionally nervous and invariably sillyMrBennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could doHe delighted in going to when he was least and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonthSo near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temperor _her_ affectionate heartThe darling wish of his sisters was then gratified;

and in spite of every thingwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortuneThe letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her to her thatby his wife at leastif not by himselfsuch a hope was cherishedThe letter was to this effect dear Wickhamyou must be very happyIt is a great comfort to have you so richand when you have nothing else to doI hope you will think of usI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very muchand I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some helpAny place would doof about three or four hundred a year; but howeverdo not speak to MrDarcy about itif you had rather notAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather notshe endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kindSuch it was in her power to affordby the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expencesshe frequently sent themIt had always been evident to her that such an income as theirsunder the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wantsand heedless of the futuremust be very insufficient to their support;

TargetsOver the yearsit has been possible to draw the big picture of the Dukes main targetsThe group is primarily interested in spying on governments either in the West or in former USSR group has also targeted various organizations linked to NATOthink tanksand political parties. In CloudDuke the operators leveraged cloud storage services such as OneDrive as their C&C channelsThey were not the rst group to use this techniquebut it is geers as it is harder for defenders to spot hostile connections to legitimate cloud storage services than to other suspicious or lowreputation URLs. We spent months apparently chasing a ghost thena few months agowe were able to attribute several distinct intrusions to the DukesDuring the analysis of those intrusionswe uncovered several new malware families and FatDukeWe call the Dukes campaigns using these newly discovered tools Operation Ghost.. Targets and timelineWe believe Operation Ghost started in and was still ongoing as of this writingOur research shows paignWe also have discovered an inltration by the Dukes at the WashingtonDC embassy of a European Union country. Howeveran attribution based only on the presence of known Dukes tools on the same machines should be taken with a grain of saltWe also found two other APT threat actors Turla and Sednit on some of the same computers. Firstthey are very steal credentials and use them to move laterally on the networkWe have seen them using credentials to compromise or recompromise machines on the same local responding to a Dukes compromiseit is important to make sure to remove every implant in a short period of attackers will use any remaining implant to compromise the cleaned systems again. RegDukea recovery rst stagewhich uses Dropbox as its C&C serverThe main payload is encrypted on disk and the encryption key is stored in the Windows registryIt also relies on steganography as above. FatDukethe third stageThis sophisticated backdoor implements a lot of and has a very ny opaque recompile it and modify the obfuscation frequently to bypass security product detections. For Operation times The time at which they uploaded C&C pictures to the Dropbox account used by RegDuke The time at which they posted encoded C&C URLs on the social media accounts used by PolyglotDuke The compilation timestamps of dozens of samplesWe believe they were not tampered withas they are consistent with what we see in ESET telemetry data. The custom string encryption algorithm used by the PolyglotDuke dropper is identical to the one used by well as other samples from previous Dukes campaignsand is depicted in Figure. The C&C server address is retrieved and decoded from various public webpages such as ImgurImgBB or Fotolog public encrypted public webpage URLs are hardcoded in each sample from three to six URLs in a single sample and it will iterate over the hardcoded list of C&C server addresses until it is able to decode a valid C&C URL example of a public webpage containing an encoded C&C URL is shown Figure. png lead us to think that they were valid images used to look likTo extract the payload from the le downloaded from the C&C will rst decrypt the last eight bytes with RC using the same key as the one used for strings decryptionThe rst four elative to the end of the le and the last four bytes provide a value used as integrity check; that value is the same as the rst four bytes at the beginning of the blob. door functions such as Uploading or downloading les Creating processes Getting system information method Getting the list of local drives and their type Reading and writing in the named pipe Starting and stopping the proxy feature.
